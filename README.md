# DelphinadBot
Little discord bot that I am developing.

Use your discord bot token as a command line argument.

~~Currently only works on my server. I will update to have it configurable by server shortly. (As of 8/7/2017)~~

Features:
 + Customizable command prefix.
 - PUBG command to gather pubg stats of a player, using their name on PUBG. Example: ##pubg almostfamous na all
 + Check when a name of League Of Legends will be available, or if its already open. Supports all regions except Garena
 - Urban Dictionary command with ud <query>
 + More to come!
